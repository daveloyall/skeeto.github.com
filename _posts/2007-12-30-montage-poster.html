<!-- 30 December 2007 -->
<p>
I wanted to try making one of those movie montage things
I <a href="/blog/2007/12/11">wrote about earlier</a> into a nice
poster that could be hung on a wall. Now, I prefer a Spartan
environment whenever possible, so <i>I</i> really did not want to have
my own poster. No decorations for me, please. I just wanted to make
one. My solution? Make one for my sister, who has lots of junk and
would enjoy having one. Her favorite movie is <i>Pirates of the
Caribbean</i>, so I used this movie, which she conveniently already
had on DVD.
</p>
<p>
As before, I used <code>mplayer</code> to rip all of the frames I
needed. To get a poster-quality version I would need better
resolution. To do this, I changed the frame output image size to
160x90 (100 times bigger than before).
</p>
<pre>
<i>[...]</i> framestep=30,scale=<b>160:90</b> <i>[...]</i>
</pre>
<p>
Next, I used my <a href="/blog/2007/12/26"> own montage script</a> to
put these frames together. My script took about 2 minutes to put
together one of these larger montages. Finally, I used
the <a href="http://www.gimp.org/">GIMP</a> to add a black border and
simple title at the top. Since I don't have any more than 512MB of
memory on my computers, I actually had to scale the image down to 1/4
of its original size to do this. Before scaling, the GIMP was spending
hours just adding the border because it was thrashing the hard
drive. It needed about 2G of memory and it was using the hard drive to
get it.

I took my giant image to FedEx Kinko's where they printed it to a
2'x2' poster for 30 bucks. Here are the results, taken using my
sister's crappy Kodak camera (never buy Kodak digital cameras, as they
all suck!). To help see what is going on, I provided a glare version
and a non-glare version. Each shows different details.

Here is the normal version from before for comparison.
