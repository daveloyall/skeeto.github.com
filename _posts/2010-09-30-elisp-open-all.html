title: Emacs Find All Files

<!-- 30 September 2010 -->
<p>
Here's another bit of code I started using recently. I often find
myself wanting to open -- or reopen
after <code>kill-matching-buffers</code> -- all the files under a
specific point in the file system. I'm using it at work now to open up
all the source files in a deep Java source tree on small-ish
project. Once it's all open I can switch to any file quickly
with <a href="http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/InteractivelyDoThings">
ido's fuzzy matching</a>, flattening out the directory structure a
bit. (And the ridiculous "security" software at work imposes a
3-second I/O block when opening files, so I get to pay this all up
front at once rather than having it later
<a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?MentalStateCalledFlow"> break my
flow</a>.)
</p>
<p>
This just recursively travels down the sub-directories opening a
buffer for everything it comes across. It ignores dot-files, like the
ones your source control might litter.

         (files (remove-if 'file-directory-p list))
         (dirs (remove-if-not 'file-directory-p list)))
    (<span class="keyword">dolist</span> (file files)
      (find-file-noselect file))
    (<span class="keyword">dolist</span> (dir dirs)
      (find-file-noselect dir)
      (find-all-files dir))))

<p>
One caveat: if you have a symbolic link that creates a file system
loop, this will probably get hung on it.
