I came across the <a href="https://www.grc.com/passwords.htm">Ultra
High Security Password Generator</a> the other day, which uses a very
high quality pseudo-random number generator to generate passwords and
keys. The idea is not to use the full 63 characters as a password, but
rather a contiguous subset, such as the first 8 characters.
</p>
<p>
The website is served securely, so no middle man can sniff at it. If
you trust the maintainer not to store the generated numbers somewhere,
which he claims not to be doing, then you can use it as a nice
password generation service. If you are nervous about matching
password possibilities to your IP, then grab a batch through the <a
href="http://www.torproject.org"> Tor</a> network.
</p>
<p>
In terms of brute-force attacks, each letter from hexadecimal
characters is worth 4 bits, from random printable ASCII characters is
worth about 6.6 bits, and alpha-numeric is worth about 6 bits.
</p>
<p>
If you go with the set of printable ASCII characters, 6 to 8
characters (39 to 52 bits) should be good enough for an account
password, where an attacker must guess through an attempt-limiting
authentication system. 8 to 12 characters (53 to 79 bits) should be
plenty for a passphrase used as an encryption key, where an attacker
can brute force passphrase attempts at his leisure.
</p>
<p>
I wouldn't use this website for any serious encryption, though. If he
is logging generated passwords, he will have a nice short list of
possible passphrases to try against your encryption. So don't use it
for your GPG passphrase. Generate those locally.
</p>
<p>
This is where the purpose of my post comes in! He describes the
pseudo-random number generator he uses to generate the random numbers
at the top of the page. It's the <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard"> AES
block cipher</a> in <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher_modes_of_operation#Cipher-block_chaining_.28CBC.29">
cipher-block chaining</a> (CBC) mode encrypting a 128-bit counter. A
picture (well, diagram) is worth a thousand words,

</a>
</p>
<p>
Note that the diagram is actually being explicit about CBC mode, so
the AES cipher in the diagram is in electronic codebook (ECB) mode. I
missed this myself when initially interpreting the diagram and writing
my implementation. Here is the same diagram with the AES cipher
already in CBC mode,

<p>
I don't know if he designed this himself or not. I implemented it in C
to study it a bit. You can grab it here with git (or follow the link
and get a snapshot),
</p>
<pre>
git clone <a href="https://github.com/skeeto/aesrng">git://github.com/skeeto/aesrng.git</a>
</pre>
<p>
To build it, you will need <a
href="http://www.gnupg.org/related_software/libraries.en.html#lib-libgcrypt">
libgcrypt</a> installed (with headers).
</p>
<p>
Here is about 100 megabytes analyzed with <a
href="http://www.fourmilab.ch/random/">ent</a>, a pseudo-random number
sequence test program.
</p>
<pre>
Entropy = 7.999998 bits per byte.

Optimum compression would reduce the size
of this 100000000 byte file by 0 percent.

Chi square distribution for 100000000 samples is 275.58, and randomly
would exceed this value 25.00 percent of the times.

Arithmetic mean value of data bytes is 127.5095 (127.5 = random).
Monte Carlo value for Pi is 3.141182766 (error 0.01 percent).
Serial correlation coefficient is 0.000005 (totally uncorrelated = 0.0).
</pre>
<p>
Wow! These results are great! This is exactly what you would see if
you ran 100 megabytes of <code>/dev/random</code>, a <i>true</i>
random number generator, through ent. It is also pretty fast,
generating that 100 megabytes on my laptop in about 7 seconds. That's
much faster than Linux's <code>/dev/urandom</code> (over a minute
here), whose ent results aren't quite as good, either.
</p>
<p>
<b>Note</b>: Before you go using this somewhere important you should
make sure this PRNG has been peer reviewed and carefully studied by
professionals with cryptanalysis. It may have fundamentals flaws. I
only found this on a website somewhere!
</p>
<p>
Still, that's a pretty damn cool pseudo-random number generator.
</p>
<p>
The generator is only useful if you want to generate more than 512
bits worth of numbers, because it takes 512 bits of randomly generated
numbers to initialize the generator. If you want to generate a single
password if the same strength, give this a shot,
</p>
<pre>
head -c 50 /dev/random | tr -cd "A-Za-z0-9@#\!\$%^&amp;*()_+=-~;,.&lt;&gt;/[]{}|?:'\\\`" &amp;&amp; echo
</pre>
<p>
It uses a true random number generator and selects from 94 printable
ASCII characters (space not included).
