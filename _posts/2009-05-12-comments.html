title: I Finally Have Comments

<!-- 12 May 2009 -->
<p>
I finally have a comment system, thanks to <a
href="http://www.nukekiller.net/pollxn/">pollxn</a>, a <a
href="http://www.blosxom.com/">blosxom</a> comment system that
actually works. There is a link to it, indicating the number of
comments, in the bottom of each post. Try it out and say hello.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, pollxn doesn't have any sort of anti-spam or <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captcha"> CAPTCHA</a> system. If
you look around the Interwebs where other people are using pollxn, you
will see everyone has their own little CAPTCHA thing. Well, I am not
different. I hacked together my own to keep away automated spammers.
</p>
<p>
It selects words from the dictionary (of 40,000 words in this case)
and encrypts them with Blowfish in CBC mode, with a unique IV each
time. This is to passed to the user, who passes it to an image
generator which decrypts the word and uses GD in Perl to render it,
apply some transforms, and drop a line randomly over it. The user
submits the guess of the image along with the encrypted version
(hidden field), which is decrypted and compared on the other end. The
same encrypted ID cannot be used twice, but thanks to the IV the same
word <i>can</i> be used twice.
</p>
<p>
Here are some samples. If you hit refresh, they will render
differently.

It's not a great CAPTCHA, but it should be good enough for the low
volume of traffic I see here. As I inevitably collect small amounts of
spam (by spammers manually passing the CAPTCHA), I will gradually
create the needed tools to combat it. I can also easily update the
CAPTCHA image algorithm without disrupting the functioning of the
website.
</p>
<p>
I'm sure I will be making improvements to the comment system over time
as well. I should make it obfuscate e-mail addresses, for one. Maybe
add a preview. And better blosxom integration.

<p>
So say hello below! I am excited to finally have a <i>real</i> blog.
