<p style="font-style: italic;">
I wrote this thing back in September 2005 when I had to learn MATLAB
for work. This writeup was done about year later.

Download the code (<a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GPL
licensed</a>)
at <a href="/download/walk.tar.gz">
download/walk.tar.gz</a> (33.72KB). There are
both <a href="http://www.perl.org/">Perl</a> an MATLAB versions.

This was a text-adventure engine I wrote when I was starting to learn
MATLAB programming, which means the MATLAB code here is pretty
horrendous. It may or may not work in GNU octave, I didn't bother
checking. That's because I later wrote a Perl version that does the
same thing (when I was still starting with learning Perl, so not much
better). Included is a sample "world" to explore (in English and pig
latin!). The format for the "world" is a really simple one, probably
missing a lot of features of a real text adventure scripting
language. Have fun!

This is what it looks like,

Welcome to Walk. Just type in plain English into the 'Action:' line what you

Type 'save' to quicksave the session.
Type 'load' to restore the quicksave session.
Type 'doc' or 'help' to see this message again.
Type 'quit' to quit.

 Action: look

 You appear to be in a small bedroom. There are no windows. Light is
provided by a small ceiling lamp. There is a brown wooden door, a small bed
with no sheets, a small box which is laying on the bed.

 Action: _
