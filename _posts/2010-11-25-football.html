I'm not a sports fan, but today I saw a graphic today demonstrating
parity in the 2010 NFL season.
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://sports.yahoo.com/nfl/blog/shutdown_corner/?urn=nfl-288589">
A demonstration of NFL parity in one handy, circular graphic
</a>
</p>
<p>
Basically, for any team in the league, you can use this graphic to
trace a chain of wins back to your favored team. With it you can
always prove to your buddies how much better your team is than theirs,
because <i>your</i> team technically beat them.
</p>
<p>
To make one of these all you need is the win/loss information for the
season. Create a directed graph with it, then find a Hamiltonian cycle
in the graph and you have one of these circular graphs.
</p>
<p>
I wanted to this this out for myself with the 2008 and 2009
seasons. As usual, getting data in a usable format is the hardest part
of the whole task. Using a combination of these two sources I managed
to get some reasonable information,
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="http://www.profootball-fans.com/nfl/nfl-scores.html">
      2010 NFL Scoreboard
    </a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="http://nfl.fanhouse.com/scores-and-schedules">
      NFL Scores & Schedules
    </a>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
So here's the score data in s-exp form.
</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/skeeto/hamiltonian/blob/master/nfl/scores2008.el">scores2008.el</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/skeeto/hamiltonian/blob/master/nfl/scores2009.el">scores2009.el</a></li>
</ul>
<p>
And the resulting graphs, <a href="/blog/2009/06/21/"> expressed using
my preferred alist form</a>,

I attempted to produce a nice visual of the 2009 graph, but this is
the best I could get it. I think it's just too complex to display
graphically.
</p>

<p>
So the next step is finding a Hamiltonian cycle in this
tree. <a href="/blog/2009/05/27">I've done such a search
before</a>. It's hard to find one by hand, but a computer can do it in
a reasonable about of time. However, something to important note about
2008 is that there actually is no such cycle! As you can see in the
graph s-expression, the Lions lost every single game they played.
</p>
<p>
Here's a couple 2009 Hamiltonian cycles,
</p>
<pre>
;; 2009 Hamiltonian cycles
(Steelers Titans Jaguars Rams Lions Redskins Buccaneers Packers Browns
 Bills Jets Colts Texans Raiders Chiefs Broncos Bengals Ravens
 Chargers Dolphins Patriots Falcons Panthers Saints Eagles Giants
 Cowboys Seahawks 49ers Cardinals Vikings Bears Steelers)

(Steelers Titans Jaguars Jets Colts Ravens Chargers Browns Chiefs
 Raiders Eagles Giants Cowboys Saints Panthers Vikings Seahawks 49ers
 Cardinals Texans Patriots Falcons Dolphins Bills Buccaneers Packers
 Rams Lions Redskins Broncos Bengals Bears Steelers)
</pre>
<p>
There's nothing unique about this particular cycle. There are about
2<sup>118</sup> possible ways to arrange 32 teams. In our graph, there
are on average 7 outgoing paths from a node, so we're searching in a
space of around 2<sup>90</sup>. There should be many different cycles
in that set, but an exhaustive search is completely out of the
question.
