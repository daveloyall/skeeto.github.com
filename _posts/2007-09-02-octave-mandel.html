title: Mandelbrot with GNU Octave

<!-- 2 September 2007 -->
<p>
In preparation for another project idea I have (to be posted in the
future), I wrote a Mandelbrot fractal generator
in <a href="http://www.octave.org">Octave</a>. Octave is great for
just trying things out and prototyping your algorithms. It is very
slow, however. Here is the code,
</p>
{% highlight octave %}
function mandel_img = mandel ()
  ## Parameters
  w = [-2.5 1.5]; # Domain
  h = [-1.5 1.5]; # Range
  s = 0.005;      # Step size
  it = 64;        # Iteration depth

  ## Prepare the complex plane
  [wa ha] = meshgrid (w(1):s:w(2), h(1):s:h(2));
  complex_plane = wa + ha * i;

  ## Preallocate image
  mandel_img = zeros( length(h(1):s:h(2)), length(w(1):s:w(2)));

  ## Generate mandelbrot
  for wi = 1:size(mandel_img, 2)
    for hi = 1:size(mandel_img, 1)

      z = 0;
      k = 0;
      while k < it && abs(z) < 2
	z = z^2 + complex_plane (hi, wi);
	k = k + 1;
      end
      mandel_img (hi, wi) = k - 1;

    end
    ## Display progress
    waitbar (wi/size(mandel_img, 2));
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}
<p>
You may need to comment out the <code>waitbar</code> line if you do
not have <a href="http://octave.sourceforge.net/">Octave-Forge</a>
installed properly (as is the case with Octave 2.9 on Debian as of
this writing) or at all. You will also need Octave-Forge if you want
to use the image functions described below.
</p>
<p>
You can find the same code all over the Internet for many different
languages. The advantage with Octave is that it knows about complex
numbers so that this can be expressed directly with <code>z = z^2 +
c</code> and <code>abs(z)</code>. For an introduction on how the
Mandelbrot is generated, check out
the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set">Wikipedia
article</a>.
</p>
<p>
Now, this code just generates a matrix of the escape iteration numbers
for each pixel. To visualize this, you will need to use the image
functions. The simplest thing to do is view the data as a boring
greyscale image.
</p>
<pre>
octave> m = mandel(); # Generate the data
octave> imshow(m);
</pre>
<p>
You should see something like this,
</p>
<p>
  <a href="/img/fractal/mandel-plain.png">
    <img src="/img/fractal/mandel-plain-small.png" alt=""/>
  </a>
</p>
<p>
You can save this as an image with <code>imwrite</code>,
</p>
<pre>
octave> imwrite("mandel.png", m*4)
</pre>
<p>
The <code>*4</code> part is because the iteration depth was set to
64. The image being written will have values between 0 and 255. This
allows the data to use the full dynamic range of the image.
</p>
<p>
If you want more interesting images, you can apply a
colormap. Octave-Forge has two handy color maps, <code>hot</code>
and <code>ocean</code> (cool). To make the inside of the fractal
black, which are the points that are part of the set and never
escaped, stick black on the end of the colormap. This can be done like
this (viewing and saving),
</p>
<pre>
octave> cmap = [hot(63); 0 0 0];  # The colormap
octave> imshow(m + 1, cmap);
octave> imwrite("mandel.png", m + 1, cmap);
</pre>
<p>
  <a href="/img/fractal/mandelhot.png">
    <img src="/img/fractal/mandelhot-small.png" alt=""/>
  </a>
</p>
<p>
<code>m</code> is between 0 and 63. We add one to it to put it between
1 and 64. Then we take the colormap of length 63 and stick black on
the end. If you substitute <code>ocean</code> for <code>hot</code>,
you will get a nice blue version.
</p>

    <img src="/img/fractal/mandelcool-small.png" alt=""/>
  </a>
</p>
<p>
You can modify the code above to try to get different fractals. For
example, try <code>z = z^4 + c</code> instead,

More on fractals another time.
