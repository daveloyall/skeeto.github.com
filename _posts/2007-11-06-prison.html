I was reading about
the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner's_dilemma">prisoner's
dilemma</a> game the other day and was inspired to simulate it
myself. It would also be a good project to start learning common
lisp. All of the common lisp code is available in its original source
file
here: <a href="/download/prison/prison.lisp">
prison.lisp</a>. I have only tried this code in my favorite common
lisp implementation, <a href="http://clisp.cons.org/">CLISP</a>, as
well <a href="http://www.cons.org/cmucl/">CMUCL</a>.
</p>
<p>
In prisoner's dilemma, two players acting as prisoners are given the
option of cooperating with or betraying (defecting) the other
player. Each player's decision along with his opponents decision
determines the length of his prison sentence. It is bad news for the
cooperating player when the other player is defecting.
</p>
<p>
Prisoner's dilemma becomes more interesting in the iterated version of
the game, where the same two players play repeatedly. This allows
players to "punish" each other for uncooperative play.  Scoring
generally works as so (higher is better),
</p>
<table>
<tr><td colspan="2"></td><th colspan="2">Player A</th></tr>
<tr><td colspan="2"></td><td>coop</td><td>defect</td></tr>
<tr><th rowspan="2">Player B</th><td>coop</td>
<td>(3,3)</td><td>(0,5)</td></tr>
<tr><td>defect</td><td>(5,0)</td><td>(1,1)</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
The most famous, and strongest individual strategy, is
tit-for-tat. This player begins by playing cooperatively, then does
whatever the its opponent did last. Here is the common lisp code to
run a tit-for-tat strategy,
</p>
{% highlight cl %}
(defun tit-for-tat ()
  (lambda (x)
    (if (null x) :coop x)))
{% endhighlight %}
<p>
If you are unfamiliar with common lisp, the <code>lambda</code> part
is returning an anonymous function that actually plays the tit-for-tat
strategy. The <code>tit-for-tat</code> function generates a
tit-for-tat player along with its own closure. The argument to the
anonymous function supplies the opponent's last move, which is one of
the symbols <code>:coop</code> or <code>:defect</code>. In the case of
the first move, <code>nil</code> is passed. These are some really
simple strategies that ignore their arguments,
</p>
{% highlight cl %}
(defun rand-play ()
  (lambda (x)
    (declare (ignore x))
    (if (> (random 2) 0) :coop :defect)))

(defun switcher-coop ()
  (let ((last :coop))
    (lambda (x)
      (declare (ignore x))
      (if (eq last :coop)
	  (setf last :defect)
	  (setf last :coop)))))

(defun switcher-defect ()
  (let ((last :defect))
    (lambda (x)
      (declare (ignore x))
      (if (eq last :coop)
	  (setf last :defect)
	  (setf last :coop)))))

(defun always-coop ()
  (lambda (x)
    (declare (ignore x))
    :coop))

(defun always-defect ()
  (lambda (x)
    (declare (ignore x))
    :defect))
{% endhighlight %}

Patrick Grim did an interesting study about ten years ago on iterated
prisoner's dilemma involving competing strategies in a 2-dimensional
area: <a href="http://www.sunysb.edu/philosophy/faculty/pgrim/SPATIALP.HTM">
Undecidability in the Spatialized Prisoner's Dilemma: Some
Philosophical Implications</a>. It is very interesting, but I really
wanted to play around with some different configurations myself. So
what I did was extend my iterated prisoner's dilemma engine above to
run over a 2-dimensional grid.
</p>
<p>
Grim's idea was this: place different strategies in a 2-dimensional
grid. Each strategy competes against its immediate neighbors. (The
paper doesn't specify which kind of neighbor, 4-connected or
8-connected, so I went with 4-connected.) The sum of these
competitions are added up to make that cell's final score. After
scoring, each cell takes on the strategy of its highest neighbor, if
any of its neighbors have a higher score than itself. Repeat.
</p>
<p>
The paper showed some interesting results, where the tit-for-tat
strategy would sometimes dominate, and, in other cases, be quickly
wiped out, depending on starting conditions. Here was my first real
test of my simulation. Three strategies were placed randomly in a
50x50 grid: tit-for-tat, always-cooperate, and always-defect. This is
the first twenty iterations. It stabilizes after 16 iterations.
</p>
{% highlight cl %}
(run-random-matrix 50 100 20 '(tit-for-tat always-coop always-defect))
{% endhighlight %}
<p>
  <img src="/img/prison/random.gif" alt="" width="350"/>
</p>
<p>
White is always-cooperate, black is always-defect, and cyan is
tit-for-tat. Notice how the always-defect quickly exploits the
always-cooperate and dominates the first few iterations. However, as
the always-cooperate resource becomes exhausted, the tit-for-tat
cooperative strategy works together with itself, as well as the
remaining always-cooperate, to eliminate the always-defect invaders,
who have no one left to exploit. In the end, a few always-defect cells
are left in equilibrium, feeding off of always-cooperate neighbors,
who themselves have enough cooperating neighbors to hold their ground.
</p>
<p>
The effect can be seen more easily here. Around the outside is
tit-for-tat, in the middle is always-cooperate, and a single
always-defect cell is placed in the middle.
</p>
{% highlight cl %}
(run-matrix (create-three-box) 100 30)
{% endhighlight %}
<p>

</p>
<p>
The asymmetric pattern is due to the way that ties are broken.
</p>
<p>
The lisp code only spits out text, which isn't very easy to follow
whats going on. To generate these gifs, I first used this Octave
script to convert the text into images. Just dump the lisp output to a
text file and remove the hash table dump at the end. Then run this
script on that
file: <a href="/download/prison/pd_plot.m">
pd_plot.m</a>. The text file input should look like
this: <a href="/download/prison/example.txt">
example.txt</a>. You will
need <a href="http://octave.sourceforge.net/">Octave-Forge</a>
</p>
<p>
The script will make PNGs. You can either change the script to make
GIFs (didn't try this myself), or use something
like <a href="http://www.imagemagick.org">ImageMagick</a> to convert
the images afterward. Then, you compile frames into the animated GIF
using <a href="http://www.lcdf.org/gifsicle/">Gifsicle</a>.
</p>
<p>
See if you can come up with some different strategies and make some
special patterns for them. You may be able to observe some interesting
interactions. The image at the beginning of the article uses all of
the listed strategies in a random matrix.
</p>
<p>
I will continue to try out some more to see if I can find something
particularly interesting.
