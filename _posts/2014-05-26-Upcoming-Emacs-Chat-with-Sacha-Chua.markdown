On Friday, Math 30th at 7:00pm I will be the guest for the 14th
[*Emacs Chat*][ec]. It's an hour-long talk about Emacs, my Emacs
workflow, and some of the (hopefully!) interesting things I do with
Emacs. I'll be sharing my computer screen at least part of the time.

* [Emacs Chat: Christopher Wellons (FFI, Emacs internals)][event]

It will be live on Google Hangouts, and afterwards you will be able to
download the video in an open format or view it on YouTube at your
convenience. I'll make a follow-up post with those details when they
become available.
