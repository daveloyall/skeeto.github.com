As noted elsewhere here, I grew up in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Back
in February 2001 I got to witness Pittsburgh's <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Rivers_Stadium"> Three Rivers
Stadium</a> demolition. My dad brought our old 1980's video camera to
film it, and afterwards we dumped the recording to the computer. And
so I present another low-quality video,

    </a>
  </video>
</p>
<p>
I put this up on YouTube in September 2006, and as of this writing it
has gotten about 28,000 views. Now that I finally put it here, it's
clearly available under any of the licenses at the bottom of this
page.

We were <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=40.43783,-80.012113">
standing nearly underneath</a> the Fort Pitt Bridge (seen at the top
of the video) facing directly north, next to some railroad tracks. You
can see all three rivers: Ohio river to the left, Monongahela river to
the right, and the Allegheny in the top middle behind the Point.

That thick dust cloud you see at the end rose up and engulfed the
whole city, overtaking us as we headed back to the car. So I got a
little bit of history in my lungs. If you're some distant-future
archaeologist reading this maybe you can retrieve some particles from
my decomposed rib cage. Put them in a museum or something.
