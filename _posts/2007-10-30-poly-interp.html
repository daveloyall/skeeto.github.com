This is something I learned the other day that I thought was
interesting.
</p>
<p>
So you have some data from experimentation or from a function that is
difficult to solve.
</p>
<p class="center">

</p>
<p>
Suppose you want to estimate a polynomial curve to that fits the
data. Then you could interpolate values between the data points. Let
p(x) be the polynomial. The equation for the polynomial we will fit to
the data will look like this,
</p>
<p class="center">
  <img src="/img/poly/eq2.png" alt="Equation 2"/>
</p>
<p>
The <i>a</i>'s are the coefficients in our polynomial. We
know <i>x</i> and we want to satisfy the condition,
</p>
<p class="center">
  <img src="/img/poly/eq3.png" alt="Equation 3"/>
</p>
<p>
which, when we want to solve it will take the form,
</p>
<p class="center">
  <img src="/img/poly/eq4.png" alt="Equation 4"/>
</p>
<p>
Where the <i>a</i>'s are our unknowns for which we are solving. Notice
something? This is the linear system,
</p>
<p class="center">
  <img src="/img/poly/eq5.png" alt="Equation 5"/>
</p>
<p>
We just have to solve for the <i>a</i> vector to get our
coefficients. I quickly wrote this GNU Octave code to try this out,
</p>
{% highlight octave %}
function a = npoly (x, y)
  X = repmat (x', 1, length(x));

  for i = 1:length(x)
    X(:,i) = X(:,i) .^ (i - 1);
  end

  a = X \ y';
end
{% endhighlight %}
<p>
This is just an extremely simple and slow version of
Octave's <code>polyfit</code> function, except for the order of the
coefficients solution vector. I also wrote this function that will
take the coefficient vector and a value and do the polynomial
interpolation at that point (Octave's <code>polyval</code>),
</p>
{% highlight octave %}
function v = psolve (x, a)
  v = zeros (size (x));

  for i = 1:length(a)
    v = v + a(i) * x.^(i-1);
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}
<p>
Here is an example of my polynomial interpolation function recognizing
a parabola,
</p>
<pre>
octave:88> x = 0:.5:3;
octave:89> y = x.^2;
octave:90> a = npoly(x, y)
a =

   0.00000
  -0.00000
   1.00000
  -0.00000
   0.00000
  -0.00000
   0.00000
</pre>
<p>
See how only the quadratic component is left because the zeros cancel
out everything else? Here is an example with some added Gaussian
noise, imitating data that might be pulled from a scientific
experiment,
</p>
<pre>
octave:142> x = 0:.5:3;
octave:143> y = x.^2 + randn(size(x))*0.5;
octave:144> a = npoly(x, y);
octave:145> plot(x, y, "b*");
octave:146> hold on
octave:147> x_test = 0:.05:3;
octave:148> y_test = psolve(x_test, a);
octave:149> plot (x_test, y_test, "r")
</pre>

You can see that the order of our polynomial is too high for the data
we are using. The main problem, however, it that the linear system is
ill-conditioned. The condition number of the generated X matrix above
is 151900, meaning small changes in x result in large changes in the
solution. If we step out a bit you can see the polynomial quickly
diverge from the given data,

<p>
So, I definitely wouldn't use this for extrapolation.
