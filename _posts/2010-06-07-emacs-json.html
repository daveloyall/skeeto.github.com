<!-- 7 June 2010 -->
<p>
A printed hash table representation is pretty new to Elisp, and a bit
late. As far as I know Elisp didn't come with a way to print, and read
back in, a hash table without rolling your own
(like <a href="http://curiousprogrammer.wordpress.com/2010/06/07/data-dumper-in-emacs-lisp/">
Jared Dilettante was doing with a Data::Dumper style output</a>),
until 23.1 in July 2009. This is
when <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/NEWS.23.1">
<code>json.el</code> was first included with Emacs</a>, for dumping to
and reading from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON">JSON</a>.
</p>
<pre>
(<span class="keyword">require</span> '<span class="constant">json</span>)

(setq hash (make-hash-table))
(puthash <span class="string">"key1"</span> <span class="string">"data1"</span> hash)
(puthash <span class="string">"key2"</span> <span class="string">"data2"</span> hash)

(insert <span class="string">"\n;; "</span> (json-encode hash))
<span class="comment-delimiter">;; </span><span class="comment">{"key2":"data2", "key1":"data1"}
</span>
</pre>
<p>
Just a month ago Emacs 23.2 came out, very silently
including <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/NEWS.23.2">a new
printed representation for hash tables</a> with a <code>#s</code> hash
notation.
</p>
<pre>
#s(hash-table data (<span class="string">"key1"</span> <span class="string">"data1"</span> <span class="string">"key2"</span> <span class="string">"data2"</span>))
</pre>
<p>
With this hash tables can be printed and read as part of normal
s-expressions with the standard lisp reader and printer functions.  It
seems heavy, having to write out "<code>hash-table</code>" in there,
but I think it's because the <code>#s</code> notation will be used to
create printed forms of other lisp objects that currently do not have
one.
