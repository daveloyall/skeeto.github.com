<!-- 16 April 2010 -->
<p class="abstract">
Update August 2011: <b>Official Windows XZ binaries are now provided
at the
<a href="http://tukaani.org/xz/">official website</a></b> so I am no
longer offering them here.
</p>
<p>
Previously I had <a href="/blog/2009/03/16/"> predicted that LZMA
tarballs were the future</a>. I'd like to make a slight correction to
this: <a href="http://tukaani.org/xz/"> XZ tarballs</a> are the
future! LZMA has actually already been supplanted by the newer LZMA2
algorithm, which is most directly accessed with the <code>xz</code>
tool from XZ Utils. So look out for <code>.tar.xz</code> in the
future.
</p>
<p>
Right now I believe that XZ will get you the smallest compression of
any general purpose compressor (at a large memory cost). When combined
with <code>tar</code> it even beats
out <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7z"> 7z</a>.
</p>
<p>
Like all productive computer activity on the Windows platform, dealing
with LZMA or XZ tarballs is needlessly difficult in
Windows. <s>Archive software, such
as <a href="http://www.7-zip.org/">7-zip</a>, doesn't seem to handle
them directly yet. They can read
the <a href="/blog/2009/03/22/">underlying tar layer</a> but the
compression layer seems to be opaque. 7-zip actually uses the LZMA and
LZMA2 algorithms internally, so it's 99% of the way there. They just
never did the last step.</s> <i>Update: the beta version of 7-zip can
read these archives</i>.
</p>
<p>
So here's where the above executable, provided for your convenience,
comes in: <code>xz.exe</code> was cross-compiled in Debian GNU/Linux
using the <a href="http://www.mingw.org/">MinGW</a> compiler suite,
and it can perform both compression and decompression on both XZ and
LZMA. You can use these to pull out the <code>tar</code> archive so
that it can be accessed using the regular tools. Or you can use it to
make your own highly compact archives.
