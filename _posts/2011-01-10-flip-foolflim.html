<p>
So <a href="/blog/2010/07/19/">I've been playing a bit of tabletop
role-playing games lately</a>, so here's another game story like my
previous
<a href="/blog/2008/12/22/">Fire Gem tale</a>. I didn't think it was
<i>that</i> interesting, but I found out that some of my friends were
sharing it with each other when I wasn't around.
</p>
<p>
A recent character was named Flip Foolflim, a chaotic evil halfling
rogue. I had selected his secondary language by the roll of the dice,
Draconic, and by coincidence we happened to be fighting a lot of
dragonborn. Flip could always understand them when they spoke to each
other. I was asked why my halfling would know Draconic, so here's his
story.
</p>
<p>
<img src="/img/rpg/dragon-slay-small.jpg" alt="" class="right"/> Flip
had made friends with a dragon -- not a typical friendship,
obviously. During their initial encounter this dragon realized a use
for the little halfling. Flip would regularly head out from the
dragon's lair to one of the local towns where he would round up a
group of na&#239;ve adventurers who volunteered slay a "treacherous
dragon."  Once at the lair, he would turn on them and join his dragon
friend in killing the adventurers and keeping the spoils. It was an
arrangement both of them enjoyed.
</p>
<p>
This little scheme went well for some years until Flip, blinded by his
greed, greatly underestimated one particular group. Fortunately for
Flip, he discovered his mistake before attempting to backstab the
adventurers, and instead joined them in slaying his dragon friend.
</p>
<p>
Without his home in the dragon lair, he wandered for some time before
joining a party of adventurers (the PCs of the recent adventure). He
worked with them for some time, though not making any close
friends. None of his companions appreciated his thumb collection, cut
from the right hands of everyone his party struck down -- for those
who had hands.
</p>
<p>
One particular fight wasn't going so well for his side, a situation
that he had experienced before back in the dragon lair. In the middle
of the fight Flip kneeled before the opponent, swearing his
allegiance, and attacked his own party members (other PCs, including
my wife's character). Neither side liked this change, so he found
himself with no friends, meeting his end in that battle.
</p>
<p>
However, when my friends were discussing this I think it wasn't so
much about the story being interesting but something like, "Hey, did
you hear Chris had his character attack the other PCs last week?!"
</p>
<p>
No hard feelings, guys!
