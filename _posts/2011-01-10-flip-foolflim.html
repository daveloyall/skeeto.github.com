<p>
So <a href="/blog/2010/07/19/">I've been playing tabletop role-playing
games lately</a>, so here's another game story like my previous
<a href="/blog/2008/12/22/">Fire Gem tale</a>. I didn't think it was
<i>that</i> interesting, but I found out that some of my friends were
sharing it with each other when I wasn't around.
</p>
<p>
A recent character of mine was named Flip Foolflim, a chaotic evil
halfling rogue. I had selected his secondary language at random,
Draconic, and by coincidence we happened to be fighting a lot of
dragonborn, so Flip could always understand their commands. I was
asked why this halfling would know Draconic, so here's his story.
</p>
<p>
<img src="/img/dragon-slay-small.jpg" alt="" class="right"/> Flip had
made friends with a dragon -- not a typical friendship,
obviously. During their initial encounter this dragon realized a use
for the little halfling. Flip would regularly head out from the
dragon's lair to one of the local towns. He would round up a group of
na&#239;ve adventurers who volunteered slay the "treacherous dragon."
Once at the lair he would turn on them and join his dragon friend in
killing the adventurers and keeping the spoils. It was an arrangement
both of them enjoyed.
</p>
<p>
This little scheme went well for some years until Flip, blinded by his
greed, greatly underestimated one particular group. Fortunately for
Flip, he discovered his mistake before attempting to backstab the
adventurers, and instead joined them in slaying his dragon friend.
</p>
<p>
Without his home in the dragon lair he wandered for some time before
joining a party of adventurers (the PCs of the recent adventure). He
worked with them for some time, though not many any close
friends. None of his companions appreciated his thumb collection, cut
from the right hands of everyone his party struck down -- for those
who had hands.
</p>
<p>
One particular fight wasn't going so well for his side, a situation
that he had experienced before back in the dragon lair. In the middle
of the fight Flip kneeled before the opponent, swearing his
allegiance, and attacked his own party members (other PCs, including
my wife's character). Neither side liked this, so he found himself
with no friends, meeting his end in that battle.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps when my friends were discussing this it wasn't so much about
the story being interesting but something like, "Hey, did you hear
Chris had his character attack the other PCs last week?!"
</p>
<p>
No hard feelings, guys!
