In the past I have always posted my code plainly without any sort of
syntax highlighting. Boring! I finally got around to using the <a
href="http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/Htmlize"> Emacs htmlize tool</a>
written by Hrvoje Niksic. So from now on I will try to provide syntax
highlighting for inline code.
</p>
<p>
Htmlize leverages the syntax highlighting of Emacs by converting the
faces into HTML. It's more or less what I see in my Emacs buffers. The
exact output format can be in HTML + CSS, HTML with inline CSS, or
HTML with old <code>font</code> tags. It can provide highlighting for
any language that Emacs supports, which is just about everything.
</p>
<p>
I threw the CSS stuff in my main stylesheet so the XHTML of my posts
remains simple.

Update: This post refers to my old web hosting situation, so the
examples I used to showcase here no longer work. I'm now
using <a href="http://pygments.org/">Pygments</a> for my syntax
highlighting.
