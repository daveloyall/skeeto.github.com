My grandfather send me this video last
week: <a href="http://goo.gl/IcA5p">Harvard Natural Sciences Lecture
Demonstrations -- Pendulum Waves</a>. Fifteen pendulums are tuned to
oscillate at 51 cycles-per-minute to 65 cycles-per-minutes. It creates
interesting aliasing effects for one minute, after which the pendulums
come back into sync and the system starts over again.
</p>
<p>
I thought it was interesting enough to simulate in software, so I made
an applet for it,

  </a>

That should be exactly in sync with the video, so you can watch them
side-by-side and see the same patterns. Source,
