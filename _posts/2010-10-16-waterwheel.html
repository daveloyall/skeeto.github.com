title: Lorenz Chaotic Water Wheel Applet

<!-- 16 October 2010 -->
<p>
Today's project is a Java applet that simulates and displays
a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Norton_Lorenz">
Lorenz</a> water wheel. Freely-swinging buckets with small holes in
the bottom are arranged around the outside of a loose wheel. Water
flows into the bucket at the top of the wheel, filling it up. As it
gets heavier it pulls down on the wheel, spinning it.

You can click with your mouse to adjust the simulation. If you run it
standalone (<code>java -jar</code>) it will allow you to give it the
number of buckets you want to use as a command-line argument. It's
based on some Octave/Matlab code written by a friend of mine, Michael
Abraham. Those environments are so slow, though, that they couldn't do
it in real time like this.

This simulation
is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_theory"> chaotic</a>:
even though the behavior of the system is deterministic it
is <i>highly</i> sensitive to initial conditions. The animation you
see above is unique: no one saw this particular variation before, nor
will anyone again. If you refresh the page you'll be given a new wheel
with unique initial conditions (well, one out of the 2^128 possible
starting conditions, since this is running inside of a digital
computer).

On the state space plot you should be able to see the state orbiting
two <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenz_attractor">
attractors</a>. It's the classic butterfly image that gives the
phenomenon its name. The state space plot will look smoother with more
buckets, being perfectly smooth at an infinite amount of buckets. Your
mouse cannot possibly survive that much clicking, so don't try it.
