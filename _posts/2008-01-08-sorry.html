<!-- 8 January 2008 -->
<p>
Sorry for the lack of new material. I was apartment hunting with my
fiancee (the most beautiful and wonderful girl in the world) this past
weekend in the Baltimore area. I found a nice place in
Columbia. Tomorrow morning I am getting some oral surgery done and
will be hospitalized for awhile. So nothing new here for possibly a
couple of weeks.
</p>
<p>
However, once I have recovered, I will probably make a post
about <a href="http://www.lua.org/">Lua</a>, another about a robot
game I wrote this past summer, and another with pictures of my
tournament-winning robot from last semester.
</p>
<p>
If you are reading this post months from now and there has been no new
material, I guess you can assume something went bad with the surgery
(unlikely).  According to this book I have called <i>Scam Proof Your
Life</i> (from the AARP), preventable medical errors in US hospitals
results in 195,000 deaths. I am not worried, however.
