<b>Update 2009-6-30</b>: Thanks to HTML 5 and the <code>video</code>
tag I will be self-hosting videos from now on. This is information is
only historical.

As I have stated previously, I love <a href="http://www.fsf.org">free
software</a> and I try to use free software exclusively whenever I can
(it is very difficult to find employment in computer engineering where
no proprietary software is used). This can pose a problem when I want
to watch <a href="http://www.youtube.com">YouTube</a> videos because I
do not use the proprietary, non-free Flash player. The free Flash
players currently either handle YouTube poorly or not at all. I also
find Flash annoying enough that I am not interested in using these
free Flash players anyway (fewer ads automatically!).
</p>
<p>
Like everyone else with an e-mail address, I get links to videos on
YouTube from my friends. I also post videos there myself under the
name "throwaway0" as it is convenient not only for me, but also for
anyone who wants to watch the videos. Now, if the only way to watch
these videos was with proprietary software, I would not encourage
this. In fact, not too long ago this was true of most online video,
which was limited to a "choose your poison" type situation between the
proprietary, worthless Windows Media and QuickTime formats. No poison
for me, thanks.

<p>
I have discovered several solutions to watching YouTube with free
software. There are two steps involved: getting the video and playing
the video. For the first you have <a
href="http://www.arrakis.es/~rggi3/youtube-dl/">youtube-dl</a> and <a
href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/">Firefox</a> <a
href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/3590">Fast Video
Download.</a>
</p>
<p>
youtube-dl is a Python script that you can easily install on your
system. You just give it a YouTube URL and it does all the work. It
feels a bit like <a
href="http://www.gnu.org/software/wget/">wget</a>. The Firefox add-on
will add a nice little icon like this,<br />
<img src="/img/fast-video-download.png"
alt="Icon screenshot" /><br />
Clicking this icon will download the video. With either tool, you will
have this .flv file somewhere that you want to watch.
</p>
<p>
To watch the video file, you can use <a
href="http://www.mplayerhq.hu">mplayer</a> (without the w32 codecs) or
<a href="http://www.videolan.org/vlc/">VLC</a>. As far as I know,
these videos are handled with free software only when using these
players. They play fine (except without seeking) on my system. I use
<a href="http://www.debian.org">Debian GNU/Linux</a> so I am pretty
confident that my system is strictly free software.
</p>
<p>
Now you can watch YouTube without having to fall victim to
proprietary software.
