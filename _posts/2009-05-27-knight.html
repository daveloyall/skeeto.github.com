A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knight%27s_tour">Knight's
Tour</a> is a path on a chess board such that a knight moving
according to the rules of chess will visit each square exactly
once. Here is a program that solves the Knight's Tour for various
board sizes.

I wrote it purely for speed, and so in cases where the algorithm
doesn't blow up (taking possibly thousands of years to complete) it
only takes a few milliseconds to complete. The algorithm is recursive
and goes like so,
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Given a board marked with visited spaces and a position create a
      list of valid moves.</li>
  <li>If the list is empty, return failure.</li>
  <li>Sort of the list ascendingly according to the opportunities of
      the target space. That is, sort by the number of valid moves
      that are available from the target space.</li>
  <li>Mark the current space as visited, then recurse from the new
      position with the new board starting with the first target in
      the list.</li>
  <li>If the recursion returns success, return success.</li>
  <li>If the recursion returns failure, recurse with the next target
      in the list, and so on. If all the targets on the list have been
      tried, return failure.</li>
</ol>
<p>
The purpose of going towards targets with few opportunities is so that
we don't leave any stranded spaces that will not be detected until
much later. When it <i>does</i> run into a dead end, it usually only
has to back out a short ways and try again.
</p>
<p>
The algorithm breaks down on certain board sizes. For example, try a
120 by 120 board. Instead of nearly instantaneous solution like 120 by
119 would get, it takes enormous amounts of time. I don't yet know
why.
</p>
<p>
Also included in the repository is a Perl script for creating frames
for a video. Here are two videos, one for an 8x8 board, one for a
80x80 board.
</p>
<p class="center">
<video src="/video/knight/8x8.ogv" controls="" width="400">
  <a href="/video/knight/8x8.ogv">
    8x8 knight's tour
  </a>
</video>
<video src="/video/knight/80x80.ogv" controls="">
  <a href="/video/knight/80x80.ogv">
    80x80 knight's tour
  </a>
</video>
</p>

It's interesting how on the large one the behavior seems to be random
at some places, but all it's doing is following that simple algorithm.
