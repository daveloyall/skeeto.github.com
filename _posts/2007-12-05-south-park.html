advertising, so they may not like it. I have do not have anyone's

This was an afternoon project the other day. I found out about a
website called the <a href="http://www.southparkzone.com/">South Park
Zone</a>. This website has information on where to fetch South Park
episodes from different hosts, such as MySpace and YouTube. These
videos are stored in the Flash video format. You see, I don't have the
proprietary Flash software installed and the free versions aren't
quite ready for use yet. I use
<a href="/blog/2007/09/05#free-youtube">
other means</a> of watching videos on sites like YouTube. This means
that I normally have to either
use <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/3590">a
tool</a> to find the <code>.flv</code> file or search through the
site's HTML code manually.
</p>
<p>
In this case, I couldn't find an existing tool that could grab the
videos pointed to by the South Park Zone. I was able to find it
manually, but trying to watch several videos takes a bit of
digging. Anyway, if I really want to become
a <a href="http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/introduction.html">
hacker</a> sometime (I feel I am not yet worthy of this name), what do
I do? Well, I write a program to do it for me!
</p>
<p>
I stretched my Perl legs a bit and wrote a script that will grab the
video location from the South Park Zone and download the video. The
only thing you need other than Perl is
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/wget/">GNU <code>wget</code></a>. This
is the program that does all the hard work. My Perl script just scans
the HTML and XML for the data.

Here is an example session,

The program accepts episode numbers, episode ranges, and search
terms. For example, assuming you have installed the program and
removed the <code>.pl</code> extension, this will download season 2,
episode 3 and season 10, episode 10,
</p>
<pre>
$ spd 203 1010
</pre>
<p>
You can also provide a range of episodes with a dash,
</p>
<pre>
$ spd 405-410
</pre>
<p>
With that command, season 4, episodes 5 through 10 will be
fetched. The range will <i>not</i> work across seasons! This is
because I didn't see a convenient way to find out how many episodes
were in each season. Right now the tool should be fine until season
100 (3 digit seasons) or South Park Zone goes away. It knows nothing
about South Park: it only fetches the data on request.
</p>
<p>
And finally, one of the coolest parts, it will do searches for you
too. Right now, it just grabs the first search result, but this seems
to work pretty well. For example, this grabs the famous <i>Make Love,
Not Warcraft</i> episode,
</p>
<pre>
$ spd warcraft
</pre>
<p>
I have used it a bit myself, but there may still be bugs. It also
assumes that all of these videos are <code>.flv</code> files, but the
South Park Zone is prepared for these things to be in any format. If
its popular enough, perhaps I will turn it into a "project" and version
it. It could also use a better front end for parsing option
flags. Perhaps a quiet <code>-q</code> flag,

$ spd -q 506-510 708 710
