<p>
Looking at my server logs the other I noticed that the
unnamed <a href="/blog/2010/10/17/"> Chess engine I wrote this past
October</a> recently got
<a href="http://immortalchess.net/forum/showthread.php?t=8845">
some attention on the Immortal Chess forum</a>. As far as I know this
is the first time anyone who's good at Chess has played it. They were
analyzing its behavior a bit too.
</p>
<p>
As I expected, in its default setting (the <i>only</i> setting without
editing text configuration files) it's a pretty weak engine. I did
this to keep is fast, so its turns would take only seconds even on
older hardware. In this state it searches four plies (good engines get
as high as 12). They were able to defeat it easily.

I posted some information on how they can tweak the engine without
having to edit source code or download any new files. Specifically,
it's easy to increase the search depth to six plies, or more. This
information may be useful in general for anyone wanting to tweak my
Chess engine.

  <p>
    You can increase the AI's strength with some trickery, without
    having to go to the source code. Open the .jar file with your
    favorite archive manager (looks like 7-Zip is popular around
    here), and locate the
    file <code>com/nullprogram/chess/ai/default.properties</code>. Open
    it up in a text editor and you can see some configuration for the
    AI (and remember to save your changes back into the .jar file).
  </p>
  <p>
    The most important setting is "depth", which is a default of 4
    plies right now. You can set this to any <b>even</b> number. If
    you're on modern hardware, 6 plies is still reasonably fast. 8 if
    you're patient. It's multithreaded, so more cores means faster
    AI. Each increase in ply is probably a strength increase of about
    200-250, so 4 to 6 is about a 450 point increase.
  </p>
  <p>
    You can also adjust piece values and situational weights ("safety"
    is king safety), which could possibly yield a more powerful
    AI. Changing these will not cause any more CPU use, but the payoff
    will probably be little.
  </p>

<p>
The next step to making it stronger would be running a Java profiler,
finding the bottlenecks, and getting the engine sped up enough to
search more plies in the same amount of time. This would certainly
involve tightening up memory use, because the tree search currently
creates lots and lots of garbage. Another option is using opening
books, but that's not something I'm interested in doing â€” I like that
it currently doesn't really rely on any domain knowledge.
</p>
<p>
Even though it's a below-average engine, it looks like it still made
it into some personal Chess engine collections. Perhaps I should have
put some credits in there so that, in the future, they could have
found their way back here. I should have also stuck the source code in
the .jar so they'd have it around too.
