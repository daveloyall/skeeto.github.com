I was reading through the <a
href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/Overview.html">HTML 5</a>
specification earlier tonight and I was delighted to come across an
obvious reference to the <a href="http://www.venganza.org/">Flying
Spaghetti Monster</a>, complete with notes about His "noodly
appendages". I'm guessing that someone silently slipped it in there
and the people that might be offended won't get the reference
anyway.

<p>
It's in <a
href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/Overview.html#a-group-of-images-that-form-a-single-larger-picture-with-links">
an example for the <code>img</code> tag</a>,
</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
    In the following example, a picture representing the <mark>flying
    spaghetti monster</mark> emblem, with each of the left
    <mark>noodly appendages</mark> and the right noodly appendages in
    different images, so that the user can pick the left side or the
    right side in an adventure.
  </p>

For those who are unaware, it is the deity in a parody religion
Pastafarianism. It's often used to demonstrate how silly religion is.
