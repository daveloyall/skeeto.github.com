title: Elisp Higher-order Conversion to Interactive

<!-- 29 September 2010 -->
<p>
For those not familiar with extending Emacs, when you create a
function in Elisp it cannot be called directly by the user
("interactively") without declaring the function interactive. The
simplest way to do this is by adding <code>(interactive)</code> to the
top of the function definition. The <code>interactive</code> call can
be made more complex, if needed, to ask the user interactively for
input.
</p>
<pre>
(<span class="keyword">defun</span> <span class="function-name">hello-world</span> ()
  <span class="doc">"Example function."</span>
  <b>(interactive)</b>
  (message <span class="string">"hello"</span>))
</pre>
<p>
There are some handy higher-order functions in Elisp, such
as <code>compose</code> and <code>apply-partially</code>. Today I
wanted to bind the output of <code>apply-partially</code> to a key. My
situation was this: I use <code>revert-buffer</code> often enough that
it needs a binding. Also because I use it so much, I wanted it to
stop asking me for confirmation. (Yes,
there <a href="http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/YesOrNoP"> are other
ways to do this</a> including <code>revert-without-query</code>, but I
wanted a general solution.) Using <code>apply-partially</code> I could
supply the needed function arguments at keybind time.
</p>
<p>
The problem is that you can only bind interactive functions, and the
output of <code>apply-partially</code> is not interactive. A quick way
to work around this is to wrap it in an anonymous function, which also
takes away the need for <code>apply-partially</code>.
</p>
<pre>
(<span class="keyword">lambda</span> () (interactive) (revert-buffer nil t))
</pre>
<p>
I'd rather there be <i>another</i> higher-order function that takes a
non-interactive function and creates an interactive version. Here it is,
</p>
<pre>
<span class="comment-delimiter">;; </span><span class="comment">ID: c7db6dec-e7ab-3b0f-bf26-0fa268674c6c</span>
(<span class="keyword">defun</span> <span class="function-name">expose</span> (function)
  <span class="doc">"Return an interactive version of FUNCTION."</span>
  (<span class="keyword">lexical-let</span> ((lex-func function))
    (<span class="keyword">lambda</span> ()
      (interactive)
      (funcall lex-func))))
</pre>
<p>
Now the binding looks like this,
</p>
<pre>
(global-set-key [f2] (expose (apply-partially 'revert-buffer nil t)))
</pre>
<p>
I think this more clearly expresses my intention than
the <code>lambda</code> wrapper would. Maybe?
</p>
