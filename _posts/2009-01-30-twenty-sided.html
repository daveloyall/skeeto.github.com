When I played a Dungeons and Dragons campaign back in college, I
thought it would be interesting to take notes and chronicled the
campaign as a short story. I <a href="/blog/2008/12/22"> have shared a
piece of it already</a>, but I can't remember too many more
details. It would have been a lot of work to do it all.

Well, a couple of years ago, Shamus Young put in the huge effort and
<i>did</i> document a campaign that he ran. It is called <a
href="http://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/?cat=1">The Twenty
Sided Tale</a>. If you enjoy tabletop games, or are interested in
them, I strongly recommend reading through it. Hell, even if you want
to read a great story, I recommend it.

Sprinkled in between the story's paragraphs are DM notes where Shamus
gives some in-game context to the events. It provides some information
about what the players know and reasoning about their decisions. The
most interesting are his insights as a DM. It is really quite
inspiring. Shamus knows his games.

The story is really amazing as well. He actually had two unrelated
stories going that the players managed to merge together perfectly all
by accident. The end was so fantastic that it gave me chills the first
time I read it.
