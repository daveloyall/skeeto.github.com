*Update May 2011: I've made some changes, including putting this into
the public domain, so I finally just checked this into a repository.
This little thing still gets a lot of use!*

I needed a hash table written in C for a project I was working on and
I didn't like any the free hash table code that was out there. Plus, I
have NIH syndrome and I really wanted to write my own for fun. My goal
was to make it extremely generic, so that it would work with any data
of any size. A small front end could be placed on top to make it work
cleanly for strings (no need to pass the length of the data).

It uses [open hashing][oh], with linked lists to store the data. The
only penalty from collisions is a slightly slower lookup. This also is
what alows the variable entry sizes. I could definitely fix up a few
things to make it more efficient. The default hash function uses
modulus, which is quite expensive.

It works just fine with all my tests so far, so it suits my needs for
the project. The code includes a demo of the hash table (`main.c`). If
you want to read about some better hashing functions and use one with
this hash table, take a look at
[A Hash Function for Hash Table Lookup][funcs].
