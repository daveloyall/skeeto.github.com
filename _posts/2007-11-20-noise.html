title: Noise Fractals and Clouds
layout: post
---

<!-- 20 November 2007 -->
<p>
I was reading about fractal terrains and wanted to give it a shot. As
usual, I like to try things out
in <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/octave/">GNU Octave</a> first
by writing up a quick prototype, and, if it is still interesting
enough, I will move to another language for better performance (Octave
can be frustratingly slow sometimes). Additionally, when it comes to
matrix manipulation, the Matlab language tends to be the most concise
and powerful. Most functions and operators work on entire matrices or
vectors at a time, avoiding many iteration loops, and, more notably,
matrix notation built right into the language. This is powerful in the
same way regular expressions are built into Perl. The problem is when
your data shouldn't be in matrix form, and the language, lacking any
other kinds of data structures (especially hash tables! (ignoring the
struct hack)), forces you to fit your problem into matrices. Also, the
implementations of the Matlab language tend to be <i>very</i> slow.
</p>
<p>
&lt;/rant&gt; Anyway, back to noise.
</p>
<p>
So, the first and easiest noise algorithm I found was
the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamond-square_algorithm">
diamond-square algorithm</a>. Basically, it is noisy interpolation
applied recursively. All of the noise adds up to provide something
that may be good for height maps, possibly providing procedurally
generated terrain for a game. Here is an example/pretty
picture. Imagine this as being terrain,
</p>
<p>
  <img src="/img/noise/terrain.png"
       alt="heightmap" />
</p>
<p>
You can see we have a sort of mountain going on in the middle. Here is
the "plasma fractal" view of our noise.
</p>
<p>
  <img src="/img/noise/terrain-flat.png"
       alt="bird's eye view" width="250" />
</p>
<p>
These were generated using this Octave code. I believe that this is
both the fastest and most concise way to do this in Octave. You can
see we are throwing away a lot of random values that we pulled, but at
the same time avoiding loops. You will need at least version 2.9 of
Octave because, as far as I know, Octave 2.1 doesn't
have <code>interp2</code>. And, unfortunately, <code>interp2</code> is
much slower than it probably could be.
</p>
{% highlight octave %}
function m = diamond_square (m, i, c)
  if isempty (m)
    m = zeros (2);
  end

  for k = 1:i
    m = interp2 (m, 1);

    ## Define points we want to randomize
    gridmap = ones (size (m));
    gridmap(1:2:end, 1:2:end) = 0;
    gridmap = find(gridmap);       # Makes Octave happy

    ## Define random values to be added
    randmap = c * randn (size (m));

    m(gridmap) += randmap(gridmap);

    c = c / 2;
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}
<p>
Something of note here compared to other implementations of
diamond-square, my code above adds Gaussian noise (with
Octave's <code>randn</code>) rather than uniform noise. The scaling
variable <code>c</code> is actually adjusting the standard deviation
of our noise and not the limits of the noise. I imagine this makes the
terrain more natural, as Gaussian noise tends to approximate real
noise well.
</p>
<p>
The first argument provides a base terrain to work from. With this you
can define a mountain, islands, hillside, etc. When an empty matrix is
provided, the terrain will be grown from flat ground. The second
argument decides how many iterations we are going to run. The above
example performs 6 iterations on flat terrain. The last argument
decides how dramatic the terrain is, which doesn't have much meaning
when starting from flat terrain. The example above was produced with
two calls like this (one for each image),
</p>
<pre>
octave> mesh(m=diamond_square([], 6, 0.1))
octave> imagesc(m); colormap(gray);
</pre>
<p>
We can add some water, or perhaps lava or something, by choosing a
water height and chopping off everything below it. I will
choose <code>-0.1</code> as our water level.
</p>
<pre>
octave> w = m;
octave> w(w &lt; -0.01) = -0.01;
octave> mesh(w)
</pre>
<p>
  <img src="/img/noise/water.png" alt="Water" />
</p>
<p>
Here is an example of providing some base terrain. Let's put a
mountain in the corner of the map,
</p>
<pre>
octave> a = [0 0 0 0 0; 0 0 0 0 0; 0 0 0 0 0; 0 0 0 1 0; 0 0 0 0 0]
octave> mesh (b = diamond_square (a, 4, 0.15))
</pre>
<p>
  <img src="/img/noise/mount.png"
       alt="Mountain base" />
</p>
<p>
Becomes,
</p>
<p>
  <img src="/img/noise/mount-noise.png"
       alt="Mountain noise" />
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://octave.sourceforge.net/">Octave-Forge</a> has
a <code>surf</code> function that <i>should</i> make this look nicer,
but it doesn't. If we want to render this to make it look nice, we
will need another program to do it. Let's do that another time.
</p>
<p>
Another way to make noise
is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perlin_noise">Perlin
noise</a>. Generally, this noise will be better and more useful than
diamond-square noise (examples later). I personally like this person's
approach: <a href="http://freespace.virgin.net/hugo.elias/models/m_perlin.htm">
Perlin Noise</a>. It is easy to implement and understand, though it
doesn't have the all advantages you get from generating Perlin noise
the normal way.
</p>
<p>
If you don't feel like clicking through and see the nice introduction
to Perlin noise there, here is the idea of this approach: we create
different frequencies of noise and mix them all together, giving more
weight to lower frequency noise than high frequency noise. Below, you
can see that I generated (Gaussian) noise in different frequencies,
smoothing by spline interpolation. Then we add this all together to
get our final Perlin noise.

</p>
<p>
Here is the Octave code I am using to generate Perlin noise,
</p>
{% highlight octave %}
function s = perlin (m)
  s = zeros(m);    # output image
  w = m;           # width of current layer
  i = 0;           # iterations
  while w > 3
    i = i + 1;
    d = interp2(randn(w), i-1, "spline");
    s = s + i * d(1:m, 1:m);
    w -= ceil(w/2 - 1);
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}
<p>
The first and only argument gives the side length of the image you
want to generate - it only generates square images. This is an
extremely simple approach, as there are no parameters to adjust to
define the nature of the noise you want to generate. Fortunately, what
I am going to try next works fine without these parameters (or with
the default, hard-coded parameters if you wish).
</p>
<p>
Continuing with using
some <a href="http://freespace.virgin.net/hugo.elias/models/m_clouds.htm">
ideas from Hugo Elias</a> (I think that's his name), I am going to use
this noise to attempt to create some realistic looking clouds.
</p>
<p>
First, we will generate some noise. Let's generate some Perlin noise,
</p>
<pre>
octave> n = perlin (200);
</pre>
<p>
  <img src="/img/noise/perlin.png"
       alt="Perlin noise" />
</p>
<p>
Now, this doesn't look too much like clouds. To get clouds, we can
apply an exponential function to the data and set anything below 0 to
0 (contrast stretching). If we scale our noise between 0 and 1, the
function will look like this,
</p>
<p>
  <img src="/img/noise/exp.png"
       alt="Exponential function" />
</p>
<p>
To adjust the clouds, we can move this function left and right across
the x-axis. We can adjust the "time constant" of the function to
change the sharpness of the clouds. Here is the function I wrote to
convert the diamond-square or Perlin noise into cloud cover. The
output is scaled between 0 and 255 to aid in image output.
</p>
{% highlight octave %}
function a = get_clouds (a)
  ## Scale a between 0 and 1
  a = a - min(a(:));
  a = a / max(a(:));

  ## Parameters
  density = 0.5;
  sharpness = 0.1;

  a = 1 - e.^(-(a - density) * sharpness);
  a(a < 0) = 0;

  ## Scale between 0 to 255 and quantize
  a = a / max(a(:));
  a = round(a * 255);
end
{% endhighlight %}
<p>
Now run this on our noise,
</p>
<pre>
octave> c = get_clouds(n);
</pre>
<p>
  <img src="/img/noise/cloud-noise.png"
       alt="Perlin Clouds" />
</p>
<p>
Well, that looks a bit more like cloud cover. We just need to apply a
colormap to this. I wrote this colormap function for this purpose,
</p>
{% highlight octave %}
function c = cloud_cmap ()
  c = [0.25 0.25 1];
  for i = 2:256
    c(i, :) = (i-2)/256 * (1 - c(2, :)) + c(2, :);
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}
<p>
Apply the colormap,
</p>
<pre>
octave> imwrite("clouds.png", c+1, cloud_cmap)
</pre>
<p>
  <img src="/img/noise/clouds.png"
       alt="Clouds" />
</p>
<p>
Wow, that looks pretty good now. We could improve this by fading to
transparent rather than blue. Then do a projective transformation on
the clouds and lay them over top a blue gradient. You could do this
with image editing software such as
<a href="http://www.gimp.org/">GIMP</a>, or you can continue to use
Octave like I did at the end of this post.
</p>
<p>
So, in about 30 lines of Octave (including code on the interactive
command line) code we could generate some kind-of realistic looking
clouds. Here, I will use the cloud demo to show one particular
advantage of Perlin noise over diamond-square (or at least my
implementation). Here are some diamond-square clouds,
</p>
<p>
  <img src="/img/noise/ds-clouds1.png"
       alt="Clouds" />
  <img src="/img/noise/ds-clouds2.png"
       alt="Clouds" />
  <img src="/img/noise/ds-clouds3.png"
       alt="Clouds" />
</p>
<p>
And here are some Perlin clouds, which I think look a bit better,
</p>
<p>
  <img src="/img/noise/perlin-clouds1.png"
       alt="Clouds" />
  <img src="/img/noise/perlin-clouds2.png"
       alt="Clouds" />
  <img src="/img/noise/perlin-clouds3.png"
       alt="Clouds" />
</p>
<p>
Notice the straight lines in the diamond-square clouds? You can see it
right in the middle of the first image. This comes from the way that
the 2-dimensional interpolation stretches the noise in the vertical
and horizontal directions, drawing these lines out. This may only be
apparent in my implementation, as I am probably missing the "diamond"
part of the algorithm. Oh well.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, to take the clouds a bit further, you can use
Octave's <code>imperspectivewarp</code> to apply a perspective
transformation to the cloud images. I put some code together that does
this transformation as well as adds a gradient,
</p>
{% highlight octave %}
function i = pers_clouds (n)
  w = size(n, 1);
  c = get_clouds (n);
  t = -pi/32;
  P = [cos(t) sin(t) 0; -sin(t) cos(t) 0; 0.001 0.002 1];

  ## Perspective transformation
  pc = imperspectivewarp (c/255, P, "cubic");
  pw = size(pc, 1);
  ph = size(pc, 2);

  ## Create and combine background gradient
  [dump back] = meshgrid(1:ph, 1:pw);
  i = pc * 4 * pw + back;

  ## Fit between 0 to 255 for image
  i = i - min (i(:));
  i = round (i / max (i(:)) * 255);
  i(isnan(i)) = 0;
end
{% endhighlight %}
<p>
Provide either Perlin noise or diamond-square noise and it will return
an image that you can write out to a file,
</p>
<pre>
octave> n = perlin (1000);
octave> imwrite ("clouds.png", pers_clouds(n) + 1, cloud_cmap)
</pre>
<p>
After cropping the image with something
like <a href="http://kolourpaint.sourceforge.net/">kolourpaint</a> (as
I did below), you get,
</p>
<p>
  <img src="/img/noise/persclouds.png"
       alt="Clouds by Perspective" />
</p>
<p>
Then we could try sticking it in an image,
</p>

       style="vertical-align:middle"
