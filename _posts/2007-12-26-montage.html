<!-- 26 December 2007 -->
<p>
I had written a previous post
called <a href="/blog/2007/12/11#movies">
Movie DNA</a> where I described a simple way of distilling an entire
movie down to a single frame. It involved the use of two tools, with
no intermediate code or software in the middle to glue things
together.
</p>
<p>
The first tool, <a href="http://www.mplayerhq.hu/">mplayer</a> was
used to dump all of the frames we needed. This took about the running
length of the movie to do, which wasn't so bad. There may be a way to
speed this up by giving mplayer some extra hints. I have not yet
figured this part out.
</p>
<p>
The real time cost was in <a href="http://www.imagemagick.org">
ImageMagick's</a> <code>montage</code> tool, which made the final
montage out of the images. This took between 6 and 10 hours to do
this, depending on the length of the movie. The process seemed to be
non-linear for some reason, with long movies taking unproportionally
longer to process (One could always dig around the montage source to
find out why). I knew there had to be a way that this could be
improved!
</p>
<p>
Well, I wrote a Perl script last night, dubbed <code>gdmontage</code>
to speed up the montage process. It was even faster than I thought it
would be, <b>taking only 12 seconds</b> on the same machine as
before. It uses the <a href="http://www.boutell.com/gd/">GD Graphics
Library</a> via
Perl's <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/GD/GD.pm">GD module</a>,
which you would need to install to use this. It also uses
the <a href="http://search.cpan.org/~fluffy/Term-ProgressBar-2.09/lib/Term/ProgressBar.pm">Term::ProgressBar</a>,
if it's available, to provide a progress bar
and <acronym title="Estimated Time of Arrival">ETA</acronym>.
</p>
<p>
Like the original <code>montage</code> program, the script recognizes
file globs, so you can provide the files through a glob in order to
avoid the limits on command line arguments.
</p>
<pre>
$ ./gdmontage.pl "frames/*"
</pre>
<p>
It is a bit unfair to call my code a "faster montage" because it only
covers a tiny subset of the original <code>montage</code>. It makes
some big assumptions in order to be faster; specifically, it assumes
that every image is the same size. The original montage must look at
every image before it even starts in order to determine the dimensions
and placement of the final image.
</p>
<p>
It is also geared towards the Cinema Redux thing, doing only 60 images
per row. This can be changed internally (no command line arguments for
this) by adjusting the parameters at the top of the script. The script
could probably be easily expanded to include most of the features of
ImageMagick's montage, but I am sure this Perl script would be much
faster when it comes to creating large montage's. (Why
is <code>montage</code> so slow?)
</p>

Anyway, you can get the script
here: <a href="/download/gdmontage.perl">
gdmontage.pl</a> (GPLv3)
