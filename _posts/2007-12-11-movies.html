<p class="abstract">
<a href="/blog/2007/12/26/">A follow-up of this post</a> has a script
that can do the montage part the job much faster than ImageMagick.
</p>
<p>
Brendan Dawes has this interesting idea he
calls <a href="http://www.brendandawes.com/sketches/redux/">Cinema
Redux</a>. A entire film is distilled down to a single image. You take
one frame from each second of the movie, shrink that frame down to 8x6
pixels, then line them up in a montage with 60 frames per row. Each
row then represents one minute of film. There are 8 examples on his
website.
</p>
<p>
I was interested in trying this for myself, but I couldn't find any of
his code, which he had written in Java, to do it myself. Then it hit
me: I really don't need to write <i>anything</i> to do this! Here is
how you can make your own using only two
tools: <a href="http://www.mplayerhq.hu">mplayer</a>
and <a href="http://www.imagemagick.org">ImageMagick</a>.
</p>
<p>
Originally I thought that I may need to write a small Perl script to
glue these two things together, but found, after digging
though <code>man</code> pages, that this was completely
unnecessary. There are two steps involved and each tool does one step:
grab all of the frames, and second, make a montage out of those
frames. Grabbing the frames is one call to <code>mplayer</code>,
</p>
<pre>
mplayer -vo jpeg:outdir=frames -ao dummy -vf framestep=30,scale=8:6 \
        <i>video_file</i>
</pre>
<p>
What we are doing here is dumping every 30th frame (assuming 30
frames-per-second) into a directory named <code>frames</code>. These
images will be named by consecutive 8-digit numbers. These frames are
also resized down to 8x6 pixels. If you are converting a video with a
different aspect ratio, such as a wide-screen movie without
letter-boxing, you will need to adjust this. A wide-screen film would
be 16x9.
</p>
<p>
Next, we glue these frames together with ImageMagick,
</p>
<pre>
montage -geometry +0+0 -background black -tile 60x "frames/*jpg" \
        montage.jpg
</pre>
<p>
This will create the montage in the
file <code>montage.jpg </code>. There is something important to note
here. See how the file glob is quoted so that the shell will not
expand it? Thats because listing 7000 frames pushes the limits of the
system in passing command line arguments. ImageMagick knows about file
globs and will do this internally.
</p>
<p>
And that's it! I put these together into
a <a href="/download/cinrdx.sh">handy shell
script</a> that will also remove the frames after the montage has been
successfully created. The process takes between 6 and 12 hours,
depending on the length of the movie. It takes the movie running time
to produce all the frames file, then it spends the rest of the time
creating the montage, which is disappointingly slow. (Maybe I could
write a Perl script that does it faster?) The script will create a
montage out of just about any video you throw at it, thanks
to <code>mplayer</code>. Example usage for DVDs,
</p>
<pre>
$ ./cinrdx.sh dvd://
</pre>
<p>
I did it on three movies so far: <i>Gladiator</i>, <i>Tron</i>,
and <i>The Matrix</i>. I did it to
<i>Tron</i> and <i>The Matrix</i> because I wanted to see if these
movies have a dominant color scheme.
</p>
<p class="center">
<i>Gladiator</i><br />
<a href="/img/cinrdx/gladiator.jpg">
  <img src="/img/cinrdx/gladiator-thumb.jpg" alt="Gladiator" />
</a><br />
<i>Tron</i><br />
<a href="/img/cinrdx/tron.jpg">
  <img src="/img/cinrdx/tron-thumb.jpg" alt="Tron" />
</a><br />
<i>The Matrix</i><br />
<a href="/img/cinrdx/matrix.jpg">
  <img src="/img/cinrdx/matrix-thumb.jpg" alt="The Matrix" />
</a>
</p>
<p>
To inspect the coloring of these films, I took a hue
histogram. <i>Tron</i> is very obvious: lots of blues and cyans
dominate,
</p>
<p>
  <img src="/img/cinrdx/tron-hist.png"
       alt="Tron Hue Histogram" />
</p>
<p>
I was expecting to see a lot of green show up in <i>The Matrix</i>,
but was a little bit disappointed,
</p>
<p>
  <img src="/img/cinrdx/matrix-hist.png"
       alt="The Matrix Hue Histogram" />
</p>
<p>
To get these histograms, I loaded the images into GNU Octave,
converted it to HSV so that the red channel is really the hue
channel. Then I had the GIMP make the histograms by providing the
histogram of the "red" (read hue) channel. I dropped an HSV color bar
below with some image editing.
</p>
<pre>
octave> m = imread("movie.jpg");
octave> [x map] = rgb2ind(m);
octave> map = rgb2hsv(map);
octave> imwrite("movie-hsv.jpg", x, map);
</pre>
<p>
See if you can find some really interesting things to do with this.
