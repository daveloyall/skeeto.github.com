title: Emacs Web Servlets

<!-- 3 November 2009 -->
<p>
Remember that <a href="http://nullprogram.com/blog/2009/05/17/">Emacs
web server I wrote</a> back in May? Well, I got an e-mail last night
from Chunye Wang containing a patch with a variant of my dynamic lisp
idea, called "servlets" (not to be confused with Java
servlets). Chunye had similar concept for an Emacs web server for a
long time, but never implemented because Emacs lacked network
functionality until recently (Specifically, <a
href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/NEWS.22.1">
<code>make-network-process</code></a> in Emacs 22.1, June 2007). This
led Chunye to find my implementation.
</p>
<p>
Again, you can clone/view the code here. I turned the patch into a
series of commits,
</p>
<pre>
git clone <a href="http://git.nullprogram.com/?p=emacs-httpd.git;a=summary">http://git.nullprogram.com/emacs-httpd.git</a>
</pre>
<p>
This is some cool stuff here.
</p>
<p>
The servlets are simply functions installed under an
"<code>httpd/</code>" namespace, where the trailing slash represents
the server root. So, the function <code>httpd/example-servlet</code>
will be executed when "/example-servlet" is requested from the
server. The servlet runs on a temporary buffer, whose contents are
served when the servlet function returns.
</p>
<p>
To assist in HTML generation, Chunye also wrote a function to turn an
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S-expression">S-expression</a>
into HTML, similar to the one I described in the web server previous
post. Symbols are converted into strings, alists are attributes, and
the <code>elisp</code> symbol indicates code to be executed, and the
results used to generate HTML. For a simple hello word,
</p>
<pre>
(html (head (title <span class="string">"hello world"</span>)) (body <span class="string">"hello world"</span>))
</pre>
<p>
And for some dynamic content, a die roller,
</p>
<pre>
(<span class="keyword">defun</span> <span class="function-name">httpd/roll-die</span> (uri-query req uri-path)
  <span class="string">"Rolls a die with the requested number of sides (default 6)."</span>
  (<span class="keyword">let</span> ((sides
         (1- (string-to-number (or (cadr (assoc <span class="string">"sides"</span> uri-query)) <span class="string">"6"</span>)))))
    (httpd-generate-html
     '(html
       (head
        (title <span class="string">"Die Roll Servlet"</span>))
       (body
        (h1 <span class="string">"Die Roll Servlet"</span>)
        <span class="string">"You rolled a "</span>
        (b
         (elisp (list (number-to-string (1+ (random sides)))))))))))
</pre>
<p>
That one would be accessed from the browser with with
"<code>/roll-die</code>" or "<code>/roll-die?sides=100</code>".
</p>
<p>
Chunye provided some sample servlets that list the buffers, with links
that serve them up. There is also another servlet that will switch the
current buffer, which I find compelling. All of Emacs' functionality
is available to the servlet.
</p>
<p>
Now, to write a servlet that runs the Emacs psychiatrist ...
