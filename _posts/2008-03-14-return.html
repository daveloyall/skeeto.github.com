<!-- 14 March 2008 -->
<p>
It has been a few weeks since I made my last post. I just started my
new job at Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory, which
has reminded my just how exhausting starting a new job can be. There
is so much to learn and balance all at once, and when I get home from
work I don't feel like doing anything constructive. This is why I
haven't posted anything recently.
</p>
<p>
However, I <i>have</i> been working on the problems (25 completed so
far) over at
<a href="http://projecteuler.net/">Project Euler</a>. If you like
programming and/or math, I strongly suggest you check it out. It would
also be handy to be familiar with a language or system that natively
supports (ruby, python, scheme, common lisp, bc, etc.) or
transparently supports (perl with the bignum module) multi-precision
math. Many of the "tricks" of the problems involve very large numbers,
well beyond normal 32-bit or 64-bit integers.
</p>
<p>
I would also suggest you follow the "rules": any program you write
should have a running time of less than a minute. All the problems can
be solved with programs that don't need to run overnight. And don't
search Google for answers until you have solved it yourself. If you do
this, you will be missing out!
</p>
<p>
Anyway, hopefully I will get something interesting written up soon. I
want to get back to my once a week schedule. And happy Pi Day
and <a href="http://talklikeaphysicist.com/">Talk Like a Physicist
Day</a>!
