title: Emacs Set Window to 80 Columns

<!-- 6 October 2010 -->
<p>
When I'm coding, I maximize Emacs and enable
<a href="http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/WinnerMode">
<code>winner-mode</code></a>, turning my display into something much
like a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiling_window_manager">
tiling window manager</a>. Then I try not to leave Emacs until it's
necessary. It's a really nice way to work: no mouse touching needed.
</p>
<p>
At work they gave me a nice 24" monitor, 1920 pixels across. That's
just about enough to fit three Emacs' windows side-by-side at 78
columns each. The leftmost one contains my active work buffer where I
do most of my typing. The center one is usually split
horizontally. The top half is the <code>*compilation*</code> buffer
and the bottom half is either <a href="/blog/2009/06/23/">Emacs
calculator</a> or an <code>*ansi-term*</code> buffer. The rightmost
buffer contains something more static, like some sort of reference
material.
</p>
<p>
However, I like my main editing window to be 80 columns wide. 78
columns cuts just too short. For awhile I was creating 80 dashes
(<code>C-u 80 -</code>) and adjusting the window width manually to
size. After doing it a few times I decided to extend Emacs to do it
instead. First define a function to set the current window width.
</p>
<pre>
(<span class="keyword">defun</span> <span class="function-name">set-window-width</span> (n)
  <span class="doc">"Set the selected window's width."</span>
  (adjust-window-trailing-edge (selected-window) (- n (window-width)) t))
</pre>
<p>
Wrap it with an interactive function and bind it.
</p>
<pre>
(<span class="keyword">defun</span> <span class="function-name">set-80-columns</span> ()
  <span class="doc">"Set the selected window to 80 columns."</span>
  (interactive)
  (set-window-width 80))

(global-set-key <span class="string">"\C-x~"</span> 'set-80-columns)
</pre>
<p>
For those paying extra attention: instead of writing the extra
function, you could
use <a href="/blog/2010/09/29/">my <code>expose</code> function from
the other day</a>.
</p>
<pre>
(global-set-key <span class="string">"\C-x~"</span> (expose (apply-partially 'set-window-width 80)))
</pre>
<p>
The problem with this, though, is the dynamically generated function
doesn't have a name or a docstring. Someone
using <code>describe-key</code> would have little information to go
on.
