<!-- 3 April 2008 -->
<p>
At work I am currently maintaining/adding features to a rather large
piece of software. It takes over two hours just to build (but this is
mostly because C++ takes a long time to compile, being the ugly mess
C++ is). I wondered if there would be any, let's say "interesting",
comments in there. With all that code there had to be something! I ran
this to find out,
</p>
<pre>
find . -name "*.[chCH]" -exec grep \
	'damn\|fuck\|shit\|kludge\|dragon\|idiot\|stupid\|hell' \
	{} -Hi \;
</pre>
<p>
And I found maybe a hundred matches. A couple of us got some good
laughs for awhile reading some very creative comments and, in a few
cases, strings for debugging log output. If you want some code to run
this on yourself
this <a href="/download/pidgin-2.4.1.tar.bz2">
2.4.1 release of Pidgin</a> works fairly well. This is my favorite
comment, which is followed by a piece of code handling just what it is
talking about,
</p>
<pre>
/* holy crap. who the fuck would transfer gigabytes through AIM?! */
</pre>
<p>
For an easier way to search a whole lot of code, someone has already
<a href="http://www.kottke.org/06/10/google-code-search">compiled some
interesting Google Code Search searches</a> that have interesting
results. My favorite is
probably <a href="http://google.com/codesearch?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=confidential+proprietary&amp;btnG=Search">
this one</a>.

Have fun!
