<!-- 5 December 2009 -->

Yesterday was a slightly chilly day, in the mid 50s (Fahrenheit), so
when my officemate said we were getting snow I thought she was
kidding. Well, today we woke up to this winter wonderland,

My wife leapt for her camera and filmed that as soon as she realized
what was going on. We had much more than that by late afternoon.
According to the <a

Baltimore Sun</a> it has snowed on December 5th for six of the last
eight years, and we don't get much snow around here. My only wish
would be for this to have happened on a weekday. I work for a
university, and educational organizations tend to fold and give snow
days really easily. This would probably have given me a nice paid day
off!
