<!-- 1 September 2007 -->
<p>
Welcome to <b>null program</b>. This is my new home as
my <a href="http://www.cse.psu.edu/~wellons">student location</a> will
no longer exist in a few months. Here is where I will share my
projects and ideas, even if no one is looking, reading, or caring.
</p>
<p>
The name for this website comes from a phrase spoken in several places
in my favorite book, <i>The Moon is a Harsh Mistress</i>. If you have
not read this book, you are missing out. I recommend you go to the
nearest library immediately and read it. Amazon lets
you <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/0312863551/ref=sib_dp_pt/103-6664886-7819837#reader-link">
read the first chapter online</a> if you want to get a taste of
it. When I started reading it, I was hooked right away. Why is it a
great book? Because it is about an American Revolution style
libertarian revolution on the moon, and the hero character is a
computer engineer. What book can get better than that?
</p>
<p>
I would like to post something interesting here about once a week or
so. I am taking classes right now, so getting ideas should be
relatively easy. The first few posts will probably be repeating things
I have already published at my old student location. This will include
little intros to my old projects and a bunch of code snippets.
</p>
<p>
Also, separate from this blog thing are my projects, such as the PNG
Archiver and binitools. <s>These have a permanent home located under
projects/</s>. (<i>No longer here, after changing web hosts.</i>)
</p>
<p>
I am a big <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software">free
software</a> fan and you will probably see
the <a href="http://www.gnu.org">GNU project</a> being mentioned a lot
around here. I also
use <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">Emacs</a> for just
about everything I can. Here is more advice: learn to use Emacs. You
will become much more productive. After using Emacs for awhile, you
will begin loathing word processors and mice (the computer kind). More
on this later.
