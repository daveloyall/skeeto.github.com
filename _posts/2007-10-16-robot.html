Update: There is a <a href="/blog/2008/02/04/"> followup post</a> to
this post.

Here is what my team has been working on for the last couple
weeks. The end goal for this robot is to escape a maze, collect
blocks, and find a repository in which to drop those blocks. Someone
suggested we call it Pac-man. Here it is (without batteries),

And here it is being worked on. We added a third level to make more
room for the batteries and extra sensors.

Here is the game board. It is 8x8 feet with a 4x8 foot maze.

Building a robot is an interesting experience, but a stressful
one. Especially when you are doing it for a class. So many things
could go wrong and you can spend hours tracking down a bad soldering
job, which we once found inside an IR sensor. It was a poor
manufacturing soldering job.
</p>
<p>
So, as of this writing, the robot uses 3 infrared (IR) sensors to look
at walls and two wheel encoders for tracking the distance traveled by
each wheel. You can see the disk encoder on the inside of the wheel in
the second robot image. The robot uses 9 rechargeable nickel-metal
hydride (NiMH) AA batteries: 5 for the Freescale 68HC12
micro-controller and sensors, and 4 for the continuous rotation servo
motors. It is a competition, so I don't want to give too many details
at the moment in case another team is reading.
</p>
<p>
Right now it limps along in the maze and gets around for awhile before
drifting into a wall. This will get fixed this weekend, as our grade
depends on it. We just need to make better use of our sensors. I.e.,
it is a software issue now.
</p>
<p>
Eventually, I will put some code up here we used in the robot. It is
all done in C, of course.
