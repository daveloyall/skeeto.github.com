The other day I came across this neat visual trick:
<a href="http://www.patrickmatte.com/stuff/physicsLiquid/">How to
simulate liquid</a> (Flash). It's a really simple way to simulate some
natural-looking liquid.
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Perform a physics simulation of a number of circular particles.</li>
  <li>Render this simulation in high contrast.</li>
  <li>Gaussian blur the rendering.</li>
  <li>Threshold the blur.</li>
</ol>

I <a href="http://nullprogram.com/fun-liquid/">made my own version</a>
in Java, using <a href="http://jbox2d.org/">JBox2D</a> for the physics
simulation. Source code is in
the <a href="https://github.com/skeeto/fun-liquid">usual place</a>,
</p>

git clone https://github.com/skeeto/fun-liquid.git

For those of you who don't want to run a Java applet, here's a video
demonstration. Gravity is reversed every few seconds, causing the
liquid to slosh up and down over and over. The two triangles on the
sides help mix things up a bit. The video flips through the different
components of the animation.

It's not a perfect liquid simulation. The surface never settles down,
so the liquid is lumpy, like curdled milk. There's also a lack of
cohesion, since JBox2D doesn't provide cohesion directly. However, I
think I could implement cohesion on my own by writing a custom
contact.
</p>
<p>
JBox2D is a really nice, easy-to-use 2D physics library. I only had to
read the first two chapters of
the <a href="http://box2d.org/">Box2D</a> manual. Everything else can
be figured out through the JBox2D Javadocs. It's also available from
the Maven repository, which is the reason I initially selected it. My
only complaint so far is that the API doesn't really follow best
practice, but that's probably because it follows the Box2D C++ API so
closely.
</p>
<p>
I'm excited about JBox2D and I plan on using it again for some future
project ideas. Maybe even a game.

The most computationally intensive part of the process <i>isn't</i>
the physics. That's really quite cheap. It's actually blurring, by
far. Blurring involves <a href="/blog/2008/02/22/">convolving a
kernel</a> over the image -- O(n^2) time. The graphics card would be
ideal for that step, probably eliminating it as a bottleneck, but it's
unavailable to pure Java. I could
have <a href="/blog/2011/11/06/">pulled in lwjgl</a>, but I wanted to
keep it simple, so that it could be turned into a safe applet.
</p>
<p>
As a result, it may not run smoothly on computers that are more than a
couple of years old. I've been trying to come up with a cheaper
alternative, such as rendering a transparent halo around each ball,
but haven't found anything yet. Even with that fix, thresholding would
probably be the next bottleneck -- something else the graphics card
would be really good at.
