While studying for my digital image processing final exam yesterday, I
came back across <i>unsharp masking</i>. When I first saw this, I
thought it was really neat. This time around, I took the hands-on
approach and tried it myself in Octave. It has been used by the
publishing and printing industry for years.
</p>
<p>
Unsharp masking is a method of sharpening an image. The idea is this,
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Blur the original image.</li>
  <li>Subtract the blurred image from the original, creating
  a <i>mask</i>.</li>
  <li>Add the mask to the original image.</li>
</ol>
<p>
Here is an example using a 1-dimensional signal. I blurred the signal
with a 1x5 averaging filter -- <code>[1 1 1 1 1] * 1/5</code>. Then I
subtracted the blurred signal from the original to create a
mask. Finally, I added the unsharp mask to the original signal. For
images, we do this in 2-dimensions, as an image is simply a
2-dimensional signal.
</p>

When it comes to image processing, we can create the mask in one easy
step! This is done by performing a 2-dimensional convolution with
a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laplacian">Laplacian</a>
kernel. It does steps 1 and 2 at the same time. This is the Laplacian
I used in the example at the beginning,
</p>

</p>
<p>
So, to do it in Octave, this is all you need,
</p>
<pre>
octave> i = imread("moon.png");
octave> m = conv2(i, [0 -1 0; -1 4 -1; 0 -1 0], "same");
octave> imwrite("moon-sharp.png", i + 2 * uint8(m))
</pre>
<p>
<code>i</code> is the image and <code>m</code> is the mask. The mask
created in step 2 looks like this,
</p>

       alt="Unsharp Mask" />
</p>
<p>
You could take the above Octave code and drop it into a little
she-bang script to create a simple image sharpening program. I leave
this as an exercise for the reader.
