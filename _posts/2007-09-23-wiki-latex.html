title: Converting MediaWiki Markup to LaTeX

<!-- 23 September 2007 -->
<p>
Today I had a large document written in
<a href="http://www.mediawiki.org">MediaWiki</a> markup. The document
was a simple one consisting only of paragraphs, all possible heading
levels, and flat lists. There were no mathematical expressions or
images -- nothing fancy whatsoever. I wanted this document available
in <a href="http://www.latex-project.org/">LaTeX</a> markup so that I
could have a nice, professional looking printout.
</p>
<p>
After some brief searching I couldn't find a practical, simple script
to convert the document to LaTeX markup (I didn't look very
hard). Everything I found wanted to do the conversion the opposite way
that was needed. It ended up that writing and debugging my own Perl
script to do the job only took me about 30 minutes. You can see it
here (<a href="/bsd.txt">BSD-style</a>
license),
</p>
<pre>
<a href="/download/wiki2latex.perl">wiki2latex.pl</a>
</pre>
<p>
Here are the main guts to give you the gist of it,
</p>
<pre>
while (&lt;&gt;) {
    # Sections
    s/======([^=]+)======/\\subparagraph{$1}/g;
    s/=====([^=]+)=====/\\paragraph{$1}/g;
    s/====([^=]+)====/\\subsubsection{$1}/g;
    s/===([^=]+)===/\\subsection{$1}/g;
    s/==([^=]+)==/\\section{$1}/g;

    # Special characters
    s/([&amp;#_])/\\$1/g;

    # Lists
    if (m/^\* / &amp;&amp; !$listmode) {
	print "\\begin{itemize}\n";
	$listmode = 1;
    }
    if (!m/^\* / &amp;&amp; $listmode) {
	print "\\end{itemize}\n";
	$listmode = 0;
    }
    s/^\* /\\item{} /;

    print;
}
</pre>
<p>
Here is some sample input markup and output,
</p>
<pre>
<a href="/download/wiki-sample.wiki">sample.wiki</a>
<a href="/download/wiki-sample.tex">sample.tex</a>
<a href="/download/wiki-sample.pdf">sample.pdf</a>
</pre>
<p>
The script will write out all the header and footer markup (including
title page and table of contents, which is what I needed) so that the
output can go right into LaTeX for processing. The script
is <i>very</i> far from being complete in terms of a "MediaWiki to
LaTeX converter", and I have no intention on making it any more
complete either. It does only what I needed it to do: handle a few
special characters, convert headings, and create lists. I am providing
it here in case someone finds it useful or interesting. Perhaps it may
serve as a stepping stone for creating something more complete.
