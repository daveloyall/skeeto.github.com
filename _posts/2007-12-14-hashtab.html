Update May 2011: I've made some changes, including putting this into
the public domain, so I finally just checked this into a
repository. This little thing still gets a lot of use!

I needed a hash table written in C for a project I was working on and
I didn't like any the free hash table code that was out there. Plus, I
have <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_Invented_Here">NIH
syndrome</a> and I really wanted to write my own for fun. My goal was
to make it extremely generic, so that it would work with any data of
any size. A small front end could be placed on top to make it work
cleanly for strings (no need to pass the length of the data).
</p>
<p>
It uses <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_hashing">open
hashing</a>, with linked lists to store the data. The only penalty
from collisions is a slightly slower lookup. This also is what alows
the variable entry sizes. I could definitely fix up a few things to
make it more efficient. The default hash function uses modulus, which
is quite expensive.
</p>
<p>
It works just fine with all my tests so far, so it suits my needs for
the project. The code includes a demo of the hash table
(<code>main.c</code>). If you want to read about some better hashing
functions and use one with this hash table, take a look
at <a href="http://www.burtleburtle.net/bob/hash/doobs.html">A Hash
Function for Hash Table Lookup</a>.
