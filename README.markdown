This is my personal blog, for hosting with GitHub pages. It's meant to
be run through Jekyll to create a static website.

Cloning this repository in Windows will lead to some difficulties, or
not at all, due to its filename restrictions. It's possible to work
around it, but a better solution would be to use a more professional
operating system.
