This is my [personal blog](http://nullprogram.com/), for hosting with
GitHub pages. It's meant to be run through
[Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) to create a static
website.

Cloning this repository in Windows will lead to some difficulties, or
not at all, due to its filename restrictions. It's possible to work
around it, but a better solution would be to use a more professional
operating system.
